This Tutorial will show you how to import a google sheet directly to R.  If the file is set to private, then you will need to link your google drive to R before importing, or you will get an error.

First you will have to install googlesheets4 package
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
if(!require(googlesheets4)) install.packages("googlesheets4")
```

locate the url for the google sheets file you wish to import
```{r}
url <- 'https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rnwe7QNMkH3WzJfFnWXZ-uvgWxTm1X4yajAEyQKEbGY/edit#gid=0'
```

Read file into R.  Notice that the default sheet that will be imported is sheet 1.
```{r, message=FALSE}
df1 <- read_sheet(url)
```

Read in second sheet in the file and remove white space
```{r, message=FALSE}
df2 <- read_sheet(url, sheet = 2, trim_ws = TRUE)
```
