The tutorial will show you how to analyze a column in different ways. 

Lets bring in a sample dataset. 
```{r}
data("iris")
head(iris)
```


Lets look at the unique species names.
```{r}
unique(iris$Species)
```


lets see how many distinct species are in iris dataset, this will be much more useful in a bigger dataset.
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

n_distinct(iris$Species)
```

Let's breakdown the species by the number of times they show up in a dataset
```{r}
table(iris$Species)
```

Let's now do the breakout by percentage
```{r}
prop.table(table(iris$Species))
```
