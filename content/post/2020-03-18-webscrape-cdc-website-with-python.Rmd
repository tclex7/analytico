## Web Scraping CDC Website using lxml 

Note: The website URL has changed a couple times during the last month, you will have to update the url as well.

Import 3rd party packages.  Use pip if you don't have them already installed.
```{python}
import requests
import datetime
from lxml import html
```

```{python}
# url to scrape data from 
url = 'https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html'
  
# path to particular element 
path = '/html/body/div[7]/main/div[3]/div/div[3]/div[2]/div/div[1]/div/div[2]/ul'
  
# get response object 
response = requests.get(url) 
  
# get byte string 
byte_data = response.content 
  
# get access to the raw bytes of the response payload
source_code = html.fromstring(byte_data) 
  
# jump to preferred html element 
tree = source_code.xpath(path)

# url to scrape data from 
url2 = 'https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html'

# path to particular element 
path2 = '/html/body/div[7]/main/div[3]/div/div[3]/div[1]/div/p[1]/span'

# jump to preferred html element 
tree2 = source_code.xpath(path2)


  
# print texts in first element in list
d = datetime. datetime. today()
d = d.strftime('%m-%d-%Y')
print('As of '+str(d)+', the coronavirus impact on the US is:')
print(tree[0].text_content()) 
print(tree2[0].text_content())
```
